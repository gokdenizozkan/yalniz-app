## What's in the name?

YALNIZ was the name I gave to a cat. She was a little one,
wandering **ALONE** in the forest where she saw me and ran in the hope of finding a new home.
She was a very cute and lovely cat. Could not bring her with me when I got back to the city.

One day, when I came back to the village, she was gone. Nowhere to be found.
Then I heard from the folks around. They told me that she was a strong one.
That she would bully the other cats in the village. That she was a fighter. That she was a survivor.
Yet she was found dead by the road, lived **YALNIZ** and died **ALONE**.

In the memory of YALNIZ, I named this project after her.
